## Group Project Guidelines

### Topic Selection

- Pick a topic and consult with your professor if needed (make an appointment and attend OH)
- Example of Public Datasets: See "Files> Class Project>Suggested sources to find datasets.docx"
- Prepare a 1-page write-up explaining the problem statement, the dataset you will use , and the goal of the project and deliverables.
- Create an action plan and a scheduled roadmap to meet the goals. This roadmap must be submitted with your report at the end of the quarter. The roadmap should address the following:
- Describing the problem scientifically
- Background study (literature review or related work)
- Dataset Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Developing Accurate Prediction Model(s)
- Evaluation of the model(s) and Testing the performance
- Developing a basic web-based front-end to invoke and run the model(s) on input data and display the prediction output
- Project report format is 2 columns, single space, 11 pt. font , written in Latex, submitted as one pdf file.
- In the final report, include visualizations, tables, and plots in your report to show trends and report the performance and training of the model.
- Figures must have explanatory captions that explain the trend depicted in them.
- Plots should also be used during exploratory data analysis. (here is a guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-f11d843b8184 )
- In the final report, cross-reference the figures properly.
- In the final report, related work (or background or literature review) section, review related published papers with methodology which may help or inspire your research project. For instance, the dataset they used, or the selection of techniques they studied. You need to indicate how your work is different from these past works.
- In the final report, discuss the conclusion of your findings in the conclusion section.
- Make sure to properly add citations to the work reviewed in the literature work and any other source used in your work.
- See an example of a research paper here: https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~srafatir/pages/documents/08999217.pdf

### Outline

- Introduction and background (1-2 pages)
- Literature review (1/2 page)
- Dataset Description and exploratory data analysis of the dataset (2 pages)
- Proposed methodology (1-2 pages)
- Experimental results and evaluation (3-4 pages)
- Conclusion and discussion  (1/2 page)
- Github link and Project roadmap and any comments about assignment of tasks to team members (1 page)
- References (no limit)

### Overall size

- 8-10 pages excluding references, following a 2-column IEEE conference formatting guidelines: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html Links to an external site.
- There is a 5 point penalty for each additional page (excluding the references).
- Make sure to include figures and tables sufficiently to share important insights and fundings.
- The Github link to the source code of your project should be included in the last page of your final report.
- Project roadmap including project milestones should be included in the last page of the project report.
