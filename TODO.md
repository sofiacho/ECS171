## Preprocessing
- [x] wait on email response
- [x] possible extra features: gender, RSSI
- [ ] add extra columns for gender, frequency of activity, acceleration, and activity status (inactive or active)
- [ ] combine S1 and S2 as 1 dataframe
- [ ] normalize RSSI data to values \[-1,0\]
- [ ] split data into training/testing sets using 25:75 split
